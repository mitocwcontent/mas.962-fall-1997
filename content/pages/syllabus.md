Description
-----------

We use type on a daily basis without ever knowing much about its origins and craft. In this course we study the history and traditions of typography and their continuation into the digital domain. Weekly studio assignments will be given where students shall develop an intimate knowledge of typography and explore new directions in applications of digital technology in the context of typographic design.

Enrollment is limited to 15.
